# Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages [AMP]


AMP is an open initiative to help publishers create mobile content that loads instantly on various user’s devices.

AMP has special HTML language and coding. It limits the styling of the page, but in return loads really quickly.

### Pros

    #1 It speeds up website load time

    #2 It increases mobile ranking

    #3 It improves server performance

### Cons

    #1 Ad revenue is reduced

    #2 Analytics are a bit stripped

    #3 Amazing speed is achieved, thanks to cache


### AMP vs. Responsive Design

    AMP has lots of advantages like faster load speed, better UX, and lower bounce rate. In theory, AMP is easy to install as well. All you need to do is to add a line of code below “canonical” in your page’s header. Like this:

    <link rel="amphtml" href="https://mydomain.com/test.html" />

    As a side benefit, AMP allows you to get your site ready to mobile-first index without much pain. Simply select high-priority pages, then place several additional tags and a line of code. Don’t forget to test your pages using Google’s (Structured Data Testing Tool)[https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/].


#### Conclusion

    AMP is still in early stages, wait and see.
